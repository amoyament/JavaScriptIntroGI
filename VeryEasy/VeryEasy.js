//VeryEasy: Create two variables and assign a number to each. 

const ageClayton = 28;
const ageAubrey = 27;


//Console log the difference between the numbers.
    //To log the difference, I first need to define it.

const differenceBetween = ageClayton - ageAubrey;

//Example output: “The difference between 6 and 2 is 4”

console.log('The difference between', ageClayton, 'and', ageAubrey, 'is', differenceBetween);

//After more research, I realized that I can console log the difference between numbers without defining difference between.
console.log('The difference between', ageClayton, 'and', ageAubrey, 'is', ageClayton - ageAubrey);
